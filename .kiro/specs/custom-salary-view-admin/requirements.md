# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a Custom Salary View for Admin application. The system allows users to submit salary information through a form, with admin capabilities to view and manage all salary records. The application emphasizes unique email handling, currency conversion, commission management, and comprehensive admin controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to submit my salary information through a simple form, so that my data is recorded in the system for admin review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the form THEN the system SHALL display fields for name, email, and salary_in_local_currency
2. WHEN a user submits the form with valid data THEN the system SHALL save the record to the database
3. WHEN a user submits the form with an existing email THEN the system SHALL update the existing record instead of creating a duplicate
4. WHEN a user submits invalid data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation errors
5. IF the email field is empty THEN the system SHALL reject the submission with a validation error
6. IF the salary_in_local_currency field is not a valid number THEN the system SHALL reject the submission with a validation error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view all salary records in a comprehensive table, so that I can monitor and manage user salary information effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the admin panel THEN the system SHALL display a paginated table of all salary records
2. WHEN an admin clicks on column headers THEN the system SHALL sort the table by that column
3. WHEN there are more than 20 records THEN the system SHALL paginate the results with navigation controls
4. WHEN an admin views a record THEN the system SHALL display name, email, salary_in_local_currency, salary_in_euros, commission, and displayed_salary
5. IF no records exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to edit salary records directly in the admin panel, so that I can update user information and commission amounts as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin clicks edit on a record THEN the system SHALL display editable fields for salary_in_local_currency, salary_in_euros, and commission
2. WHEN an admin updates salary_in_local_currency THEN the system SHALL recalculate salary_in_euros automatically
3. WHEN an admin updates commission THEN the system SHALL recalculate displayed_salary as salary_in_euros + commission
4. WHEN an admin saves changes THEN the system SHALL validate and persist the updates to the database
5. IF commission is not provided THEN the system SHALL default to 500 euros
6. WHEN displayed_salary is calculated THEN the system SHALL use the formula: salary_in_euros + commission

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle unique email constraints properly, so that data integrity is maintained and duplicate records are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user submits a form with an existing email THEN the system SHALL update the existing record with new data
2. WHEN updating an existing record THEN the system SHALL preserve the original creation timestamp
3. WHEN an email conflict occurs THEN the system SHALL not create duplicate records
4. IF an update operation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN checking for existing emails THEN the system SHALL perform case-insensitive comparison

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to follow strict security and performance standards, so that the system is production-ready and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing form data THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs using Laravel Form Requests
2. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL escape all output to prevent XSS attacks
3. WHEN querying the database THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries or Eloquent ORM
4. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination to maintain performance
5. IF API endpoints are accessed frequently THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting
6. WHEN storing sensitive configuration THEN the system SHALL use environment variables
7. WHEN querying by email THEN the system SHALL use database indexes for optimal performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all functionality, so that the application is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running backend tests THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all models and services
2. WHEN running backend tests THEN the system SHALL include feature tests for all API endpoints
3. WHEN running frontend tests THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all components
4. WHEN running frontend tests THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for form submissions and API calls
5. WHEN testing unique email handling THEN the system SHALL verify both create and update scenarios
6. WHEN testing admin functionality THEN the system SHALL verify sorting, pagination, and editing capabilities
7. IF any test fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and stack traces
