# Design Document

## Overview

The Custom Salary View for Admin application is architected as a modern full-stack solution demonstrating enterprise-level patterns and best practices. The system employs a clean separation of concerns with Laravel serving as a robust API backend and Next.js 14 providing a sophisticated frontend experience. The architecture emphasizes security, performance, maintainability, and scalability while showcasing advanced development capabilities.

## Architecture

### System Architecture

The application follows a decoupled architecture pattern with clear API boundaries:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Laravel 10 with MySQL, following Repository and Service patterns
- **Communication**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum for API token management
- **File Storage**: Laravel Storage with organized directory structure
- **Containerization**: Docker with optimized multi-stage builds

### Database Architecture

The system employs a normalized relational database design with strategic denormalization for performance:

```
users (primary entity)
├── salaries (1:1 current salary)
├── salary_histories (1:many audit trail)
└── uploaded_documents (1:many file attachments)

commissions (global settings)
└── commission_histories (audit trail)
```

### API Design Principles

- RESTful endpoints with consistent naming conventions
- Resource-based URLs with proper HTTP verbs
- Standardized JSON response format with meta information
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- API versioning strategy for future extensibility

## Data Models

### User Model
```typescript
interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  email: string
  email_verified_at: Date | null
  current_salary: Salary | null
  salary_histories: SalaryHistory[]
  uploaded_documents: UploadedDocument[]
  created_at: Date
  updated_at: Date
}
```

### Salary Model
```typescript
interface Salary {
  id: number
  user_id: number
  salary_local_currency: number
  local_currency_code: string
  salary_euros: number
  commission: number
  displayed_salary: number
  effective_date: Date
  notes: string | null
  created_at: Date
  updated_at: Date
}
```

### Database Schema Optimizations
- Composite indexes on frequently queried columns (email, created_at)
- Foreign key constraints with cascading rules
- JSON columns for flexible metadata storage
- Soft deletes for data retention compliance
- Database-level constraints for data integrity

## Error Handling

### Backend Error Strategy
- **Validation Errors**: Laravel Form Requests with detailed field-level messages
- **Business Logic Errors**: Custom exceptions with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Database Errors**: Transaction rollbacks with user-friendly error messages
- **File Upload Errors**: Comprehensive validation with storage cleanup
- **Rate Limiting**: Graceful degradation with retry-after headers

### Frontend Error Strategy
- **API Errors**: Centralized error handling with user notifications
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with accessibility support
- **Network Errors**: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **File Upload Errors**: Progress tracking with error recovery options
- **Routing Errors**: Custom 404 and error pages with navigation options

### Logging and Monitoring
- Structured logging with contextual information
- Performance monitoring with query analysis
- Error tracking with stack traces and user context
- Audit trails for all data modifications
- Security event logging for compliance

## Testing Strategy
